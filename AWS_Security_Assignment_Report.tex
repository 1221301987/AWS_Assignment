% Executive Summary
\section{Executive Summary}

This report presents a comprehensive security migration strategy for transitioning a traditional monolithic web application to a secure, scalable AWS cloud-native architecture. Our team successfully identified eight critical security vulnerabilities in the traditional setup and implemented a robust AWS solution addressing each risk through defense-in-depth principles.

The migration demonstrates advanced cloud security practices including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment, comprehensive network segmentation, encryption at rest and in transit, identity and access management following least privilege principles, and extensive security monitoring. Through CLI-based security testing, we validated the effectiveness of our implemented controls, achieving a secure, highly available, and scalable cloud architecture.

Key achievements include successful deployment using AWS CloudFormation, implementation of all core security services available in AWS Academy Sandbox, and comprehensive documentation of limitations encountered due to sandbox restrictions. Our solution establishes a production-ready foundation that can be enhanced with additional AWS security services in a full production environment.

\section{Traditional Application Security Analysis}

\subsection{Current Architecture Overview}

Our analysis focused on a typical PHP-based employee directory application running on a traditional single-server architecture. The application utilizes Apache web server with a MySQL database, representing common on-premises deployments found in many organizations.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.png}
\caption{Legacy employee directory on `http://localhost` (no TLS).}
\label{fig:traditional_app}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:traditional_app} demonstrates the traditional application running over unencrypted HTTP, immediately exposing it to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.

\subsection{Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified}

Through comprehensive security analysis, we identified eight major security vulnerabilities that pose significant risks to organizational data and operations:

\subsubsection{1. Network Exposure and Single Point of Failure}

The traditional architecture exposes all services on a single public IP address without any network segmentation. This creates a massive attack surface where compromising one component leads to complete system compromise.

\textbf{Risk Level: CRITICAL}
\begin{itemize}
\item All services accessible from internet
\item No network segmentation between web and database layers
\item Single point of failure affecting entire application stack
\item No load balancing or redundancy mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2. Insecure Data Storage and Transmission}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{2.png}
\caption{Plain-text database credentials in `create-new-employee.php`.}
\label{fig:plain_credentials}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:plain_credentials} reveals database credentials stored in plain text within configuration files. This represents a fundamental security flaw that violates all security best practices.

\textbf{Risk Level: CRITICAL}
\begin{itemize}
\item Database passwords stored in plain text
\item No encryption for data at rest
\item Unencrypted HTTP communication
\item Sensitive data transmitted over insecure channels
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3. Lack of Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{3.png}
\caption{Apache \texttt{error\_log} excerpt lacking any security or WAF entries.}
\label{fig:no_monitoring}
\end{figure}

The traditional setup lacks centralized logging and real-time security monitoring, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:no_monitoring}, making incident detection and response nearly impossible.

\textbf{Risk Level: HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item No centralized logging infrastructure
\item Limited security event monitoring
\item No automated threat detection
\item Insufficient audit trails for compliance
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{4. Vulnerable Components and Patch Management}

\textbf{Risk Level: HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating system may contain unpatched vulnerabilities
\item Apache web server potentially running outdated versions
\item MySQL database lacking security updates
\item Manual patching process leading to extended vulnerability windows
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{5. Access Control Limitations}

\textbf{Risk Level: HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item No role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
\item Shared administrative credentials
\item No multi-factor authentication (MFA)
\item Insufficient privilege separation between services
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{6. Backup and Recovery Risks}

\textbf{Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item No automated backup procedures
\item Backup data potentially unencrypted
\item No tested disaster recovery procedures
\item Risk of complete data loss during hardware failures
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{7. Input Validation and SQL Injection Vulnerabilities}

\textbf{Risk Level: HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential SQL injection attack vectors
\item Insufficient input validation and sanitization
\item No web application firewall protection
\item Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{8. Lack of Segregation of Duties}

\textbf{Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH}
\begin{itemize}
\item Web server and database on same physical machine
\item No separation between production and development environments
\item Shared resources creating cascading failure risks
\item Difficult to implement granular security policies
\end{itemize}

\section{AWS Architecture Design}

\subsection{Secure Cloud Architecture Overview}

Our proposed AWS architecture implements a comprehensive security-first approach utilizing defense-in-depth principles across multiple layers of protection.

\item \textbf{Security Groups:} Instance-level firewall with least privilege rules (ALB SG, App SG, DB SG)
\item \textbf{Network ACLs:} Subnet-level network filtering for additional protection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compute Security Layer}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Application Load Balancer:} Internet-facing ALB with SSL termination and AWS WAF attachment for web application protection
\item \textbf{Auto-Scaling Group:} Manages fleet size of EC2 web servers, scales based on CPU/ALB target metrics
\item \textbf{EC2 Instances:} Web/API servers running application code within Auto-Scaling Group
\item \textbf{Traffic Flow:} HTTPS (443) from internet → ALB → HTTP (80) to EC2 → MySQL (3306) to RDS
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Security Layer}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Amazon RDS (MySQL):} Managed relational database with encryption at rest, nightly snapshots, and multi-AZ failover
\item \textbf{Amazon S3:} Secure object storage for static assets and logs with encryption and access controls
\item \textbf{AWS KMS:} Key management for encryption operations across all services
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Identity and Access Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IAM Roles:} Service-to-service authentication with least privilege for EC2 instances
\item \textbf{IAM Policies:} Granular permission management controlling access to AWS resources
\item \textbf{Instance Profiles:} Secure credential delivery to compute resources without hardcoded keys
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Monitoring and Logging}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AWS CloudTrail:} Audit trail for every API call and console action in the account
\item \textbf{Amazon CloudWatch:} Central monitoring collecting EC2 metrics, ALB target health, and RDS performance insights
\item \textbf{S3 Log Storage:} ALB access logs, server logs, and backup data stored in S3 for durability
\end{itemize}
